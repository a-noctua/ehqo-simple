Today's design challenge from [Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/) is a fun one! We get to continues our animal theme with the following prompt: "Design a digital event ticket for a dog food brand."

I really enjoyed playing around with colors, typefaces, and ticket layouts for this one. I wanted a semi-classic ticket look, with a playful typeface. I feel like I struck a fairly good visual balance, but there's still some adjusting that could be done.
