I have long considered improving my design skills through randomly generated exercises and decided today was as good as any day to start.

Using the challenge generator at [Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/), I was given the following prompt: "Design a feedback form for a hotel and use lots of green."

I thought I'd try to make something that could also be printed and left in a room as an alternative means of gathering feedback from guests. Overall, I'm quite happy with how this turned out, especially for less than an hour of work.
