Well I already managed to miss a day in my streak, but here is today's design exercise prompt: "Design a minimalist advertisement for a dinosaur zoo".

Since a dinosaur zoo would be fun for all ages, I wanted to try something playful. I had *such* a hard time deciding what dinosaur to use, and landed on the [Pachycephalosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurus), simply because 1) they are cool and 2) I like alliteration. `Nuff said.
