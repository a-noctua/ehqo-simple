Today's design challenge from [Sharpen](https://sharpen.design/) continues our green theme with the following prompt: "Design an app icon for a rhino conservatory."

This is the first time I've made an app icon, so it was fun trying a new format. I was able to use Apple's Design Resources to get app icon grid overlays to ensure everything was within the appropriate bounding areas.

I was originally hoping to have the rhino's horn pop out a bit, but I landed on a simpler approach as I wasn't finding the results I wanted. Overall a fun, quick project!
