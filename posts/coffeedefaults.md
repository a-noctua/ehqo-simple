Inspired by a few folks in the [32bit.cafe](https://32bit.cafe) Discord, I figured I‚Äôd make a riff on the App Defaults project by [Robb Knight](https://knight.me) and [Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097) - this time with **coffee.** 

I‚Äôve been told by my better-three-quarters that I am not allowed to bring any more coffee contraptions into the home. This is probably for the best, because I have previously done alot of experiments with brewing. I will say though, I don‚Äôt consider myself a ‚Äúbean connoisseur‚Äù by any remote sense of the term. While I have my preferred tastes and methods, there‚Äôs nothing quite like a cup of joe slung by an aloof waitress at a tri-state diner. Below, I‚Äôll share my current go-to tools and beans.

Upgrades, people, upgrades!

We just added a stolen (from family) Breville Bambino Plus and Breville Smart Grinder Pro to the setup! So much for not adding any more contraptions to the home. It's been a great addition and is getting daily use. As of writing this, my drink of choice has been a flat white - a delicacy I first came to appreciate while traveling abroad and now I strive to recreate its goodness in my own home.

## Espresso Machine

### [Breville Bambino Plus](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/espresso/bes500.html)
#### Why I like it:
- I didn't pay any money for it.
- It's really easy to use and provides a great cup every time. I can set milk to heat up and walk away to do something else without any concern.

## Grinder

### [Breville Smart Grinder Pro](https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/coffee-grinders/bcg820.html)
#### Why I like it
- I didn't pay any money for it.
- The hopper has a good seal on it to preserve freshness between uses
- When switching between shot amounts, the grind time automatically recalculates so you don't have to dial it in manually.
#### Why I don't like it
- The grind comes out a little clumpy

## Primary Brewer

### [P7 French Press by Espro](https://espro.com/collections/french-press/products/coffee-french-press-p7)
#### Why I like it: 
- Durable, stainless steel design, keeps things nice and toasty
- Double micro-filter for a smoother, grit-free cup

## Beans
### Standard Espresso: Rotating

### Standard Coffee: [Trader Joe‚Äôs Wake Up Blend](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-fair-trade-wake-up-blend-coffee-098530)
![](https://noctua.b-cdn.net/images/blog/JAN24/tj-wakeup-blend.webp)
#### Why I like it:
- Look, I said I‚Äôm not a bean connoisseur. This stuff just tastes good and is dependable
- Sweet notes, with a little bit of acidity. A good way to start any day.

### Seasonal (retired): [Festive Lights by Rook Coffee](https://rookcoffee.com/collections/coffee)
![](https://noctua.b-cdn.net/images/blog/JAN24/festive-lights.webp)
#### Why I like it:
- If you‚Äôve ever visited New Jersey, you might have heard of Rook Coffee. This place is wildly good, and I wish they would expand their footprint out of state. Their seasonal holiday blend maintains their high standard of quality with a delicious cup that makes me which I purchased more before it sold out.
- Please for the love of the coffee gods, try [Rook‚Äôs cold brew concentrate](https://rookcoffee.com/collections/cold-brew). I‚Äôd recommend the New Orleans Style. It‚Äôs worth every penny and you will be upset at me for recommending it, because you‚Äôll be throwing your wallet at their website fiending for more once you try it.

## Coffee Storage
### [Airscape Kilo Coffee Canister by Planetary Design](https://planetarydesign.com/product/airscape-kilo-coffee-canister/)
![](https://noctua.b-cdn.net/images/blog/JAN24/airscape-kilo.webp)
#### Why I like it:
- This sucker holds *alot* of coffee
- The over-engineered design of the air-tight seal geek-worthy

## Kettle
### [Clyde Stovetop Kettle by Fellow](https://fellowproducts.com/products/clyde-stovetop-kettle)
![](https://noctua.b-cdn.net/images/blog/JAN24/clyde-kettle.webp)
#### Why I like it: 
- It‚Äôs simple, easy to use and clean, and just looks nice, yank?
- The two-tone whistle sounds like a train üöÇ
