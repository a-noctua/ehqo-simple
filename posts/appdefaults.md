Shortly after creating my omg.lol account at the tail end of 2023, I came across Robb Knight's post - [Hemispheric Views - App Defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/). Inspired by the countless folks who contributed, I figured I would throw my hat in the ring.

I will be reviewing and revising this list over 2024. What will I be using next year? Will my needs and goals even be the same? I'm excited about the idea of personal change-logs, and this seems like a great place to start. I intend on creating similar entries to document how my life changes throughout the year. Even since originally writing this post, I have tried to simplify my personal tech-stack.
