There is no more fitting a topic to cover today than Star Wars. Love it or hate it, Star Wars has had an incredible effect on storytelling, imagination, and the lives of millions. It has encouraged dreamers, young and old, to look to the stars and imagine vast, alien worlds filled with new ideas, as well as ways we can improve our own world now. I have been a fan as long as I can remember, and will continue to be until the day I die. Why? Because it makes me happy and gives me hope. I don’t think there’s much else to say.  
  
Tonight I encourage you to go outside, look up at the night sky, and imagine one way you can make the world (or galaxy) a better place for everyone.  
  
I leave you with this: the song [“Yub Nub”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXpmunmG5ss), the absolute bop that was removed from the end of “Episode VI: Return of the Jedi”.   
  
Lulalar! Allayloo! Nuv!  
  
See you next time, and May the 4th be with you.
